Conventions-and-Syntax It is just how you write code. Like how we use punctuation in the english language.
Every ! . ; , = etc has its own purpose.

; is used to end statements
. is used to as a full stop
indenting is just used to read your code easier
comments are just used to leave yourself notes, or you can also use it to disable code for a period of time.
// or /* */
= and != test for equality and inequality of any type
